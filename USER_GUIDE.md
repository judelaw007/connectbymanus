1. Click **Create Group** at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. Enter a **Group Name** (e.g., "ADIT June 2025 Study Group").
3. Add an optional **Description**.
4. Choose **Privacy**:
   - **Public** — Anyone can discover and join.
   - **Private** — Invite-only. An invite code is generated that you share with members.
5. Click **Create Group**.

### Private groups & invite codes

When you create a private group, you'll receive an **invite code**. Share this code with people you want to invite. They can join by clicking **Join Group** and entering the code.

### Managing your groups

Your groups appear under **My Groups** in the sidebar. Hover over a group to see the **three-dot menu** with these options:

| Action           | Who can do it | What it does                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **View Members** | Any member    | See the list of group members                                              |

| **Close Group**  | Owner only    | Permanently archives the group. All members lose access. Cannot be undone. |

## 5. Asking @moji (AI Assistant)

**@moji** is the built-in AI assistant powered by a knowledge base and OpenAI.

### How to use it

In any channel message, type `@moji` followed by your question:

```
@moji What is the arm's length principle?
```

### What @moji can help with

- **Platform help** — How to use features, create groups, contact support
- **ADIT exam** — Qualification info, exam papers, dates, study tips
- **VAT** — Registration thresholds, reverse charge, EU rules
- **Transfer pricing** — Methods, OECD guidelines, arm's length principle
- **International tax** — BEPS, double tax treaties, regulations

### How it works

1. @moji first searches its **knowledge base** for a matching answer.
2. If a close match is found, it responds with that answer.
3. If no match is found, it uses **AI (GPT)** to generate a response based on the question.
4. If @moji can't help, it will offer to **escalate to Team MojiTax** (human support).

## 6. Support — Chat with Team MojiTax

### Opening a support conversation

1. Click **"Chat with Team MojiTax"** at the top of the left sidebar.

### Admin availability indicator

Below the support button, you'll see an availability indicator:

- **Green dot + "Online"** — An admin is available during business hours with an estimated response time (e.g., "~60min response").
- **Grey dot + "Offline"** — Outside business hours, showing the admin's working hours and timezone (e.g., "09:00–17:00 Europe/London").

### Managing your tickets

- Your display name is what other members see (e.g., "TaxPro_Jane", "StudyBuddy42").
- Your **email stays private** — it is never shown to other members.
- You need a display name (minimum 2 characters) to be **@mentionable** by others.
- You can skip this step, but you won't be mentionable until you set one.

## 10. Troubleshooting

### I didn't receive my verification code

- Check your **spam/junk** folder.
- Make sure you used the email registered with your Learnworlds account.
- Click **Resend code** to get a new one.

- If you see an error, try refreshing the page.

### I can't find my study group

### @moji isn't responding
